# Nix4Loong

Nix4Loong is a community-driven project initiated by [loongson-community](https://github.com/loongson-community/), focused on bringing the NixOS Linux distribution and its package collection Nixpkgs to the new-world LoongArch architecture through comprehensive upstream integration.

## About NixOS and Nixpkgs

NixOS is a Linux distribution built on the Nix package manager with a [declarative configuration model](https://nixos.org). [Key features include](https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works/):

- **Reproducibility**: Packages are built in isolated environments, ensuring reproducible builds with no undeclared dependencies
- **Declarative configuration**: Your entire system configuration is described in a single file, making it easy to share and replicate
- **Atomic upgrades and rollbacks**: System updates are atomic operations that can be easily rolled back to previous states
- **Multi-version coexistence**: Install multiple versions of the same package simultaneously, eliminating "DLL hell" conflicts
- **Pure functional package management**: All packages live in `/nix/store` with unique path identifiers for complete isolation

[Nixpkgs](https://nixos.org) is the Nix ecosystem's package collection, containing [over 120,000 packages](https://nixos.org) – one of the world's largest package repositories. Unlike traditional distribution package managers, **Nix runs on all major Linux distributions and can install packages from Nixpkgs directly**, giving users access to an enormous selection of software.

## About New-World LoongArch

[LoongArch](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoongArch) is an independent instruction set architecture first publicly released by Loongson Technology in August 2020. This entirely new RISC-based architecture features:

- **Complete independence**: Completely self-designed instruction set architecture, abandoning the MIPS architecture used in earlier Loongson processors
- **Modern architecture**: 32-bit fixed-length RISC instruction set, 32 general-purpose registers, 32 floating-point/vector registers
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Efficiently runs [x86](https://github.com/lat-opensource/lat) and [ARM](https://github.com/lat-opensource/lata) programs through hardware-accelerated binary translation
- **Wide deployment**: Used across embedded devices, desktops, and servers

Currently, the flagship LoongArch processor is the 3C6000 series, with the 3C6000/S model offering 16 cores and 32 threads. According to [Loongson Technology](https://www.loongson.cn/news/show?id=757), its performance in the SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark is claimed to match that of the [Intel Xeon Silver 4314](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/215269/intel-xeon-silver-4314-processor-24m-cache-2-40-ghz/specifications.html) (also 16 cores and 32 threads), released in 2021.

An important aspect to understand about LoongArch is that it currently has two distinct and incompatible software ecosystems, known as ["old-world" and "new-world"](https://areweloongyet.com/docs/old-and-new-worlds/):

- **Old-world**: The original ecosystem developed internally by Loongson Technology and released with LoongArch, mainly used in commercial distributions like Kylin and UOS
- **New-world**: An open-source ecosystem developed collaboratively between Loongson Technology and the community, adopted by mainstream distributions including [Arch Linux for Loong64](https://loongarchlinux.lcpu.dev/), [Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:LoongArch), and [AOSC OS](https://aosc.io/)

New-world follows standard open-source development practices, with changes typically submitted upstream for better compatibility and maintainability. [Old-world is gradually being replaced by new-world](https://areweloongyet.com/docs/old-and-new-worlds/). Nix4Loong targets new-world LoongArch exclusively, ensuring our work aligns with international open-source standards and delivers the authentic NixOS and Nixpkgs experience to LoongArch users.

## Project Goals

Nix4Loong aims to:

- Provide [NixOS installation images](/en/installation) for LoongArch
- Ensure a certain proportion of Nixpkgs packages working on LoongArch
- Offer and maintain [binary caches](/en/usage) for LoongArch Nixpkgs
- Build bridges to enable the Nix community to participate in the development of the LoongArch ecosystem

## Current Progress

Nixpkgs 25.11 "Xantusia" was released on November 30, 2025. According to the [Release Notes](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/release-notes#sec-nixpkgs-release-25.11), initial support for native LoongArch compilation has been completed, with more improvements in progress.

Following the [Software Development and Build Convention for LoongArch™ Architectures](https://github.com/loongson/la-softdev-convention), this release sets the default `march` level to `la64v1.0`, which covers the 3A5000 and newer desktop and server processor series, but does not support platforms without the LSX extension, such as the 2K0300. You can use `pkgsCross.loongarch64-linux-embedded` to build software and systems for these platforms.

Moving forward, we will continue working on adapting more Nixpkgs packages, continuously improving both the quantity and quality of available packages on LoongArch.

## About the Name and Organization

The project name "Nix4Loong" comes from "Nix For LoongArch" (also written as "nix4loong"). Don't confuse this with [Loongnix](https://www.loongnix.cn/zh/), a separate Linux distribution from the Loongson open-source community.

This project is initiated by [loongson-community](https://github.com/loongson-community/), which is separate from Loongson Technology's official open-source community and the [Loongson Hobbyists' Community](https://loongfans.cn/).

Nix4Loong is an independent open-source project with no affiliation to Loongson Technology. All work is done by community volunteers, and we welcome contributions from individuals and organizations alike.
