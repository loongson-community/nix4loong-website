# Contributing

Nix4Loong maintains the following branches in the [loongson-community/nixpkgs](https://github.com/loongson-community/nixpkgs) repository to manage modifications that cannot be upstreamed yet or are awaiting upstream acceptance:

- `loong-master`, based on the official Nixpkgs `master` branch
- `loong-release-25.11`, based on the official Nixpkgs `release-25.11` branch

These branches contain fixes for certain package issues. We recommend using these branches and welcome your contributions. We'll assist you with the upstreaming process and continue actively pushing our existing modifications upstream.

## User Feedback

With limited resources, many LoongArch-compatible packages in Nixpkgs haven't been thoroughly tested. If you encounter issues, please [create an Issue](https://github.com/loongson-community/nixpkgs/issues) in our repository. This includes packages that fail to build or run properly.

## Contributing Work

Many Nixpkgs packages don't yet build or run smoothly on LoongArch, and some use temporary build fixes that are hard to upstream. This creates commits in Nix4Loong that can't be upstreamed immediately.

To contribute, fork the `loong-master` branch from [loongson-community/nixpkgs](https://github.com/loongson-community/nixpkgs), make your changes with testing, and submit a PR. After review, we'll help upstream your contributions to [NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/).

You can also help resolve [existing Issues](https://github.com/loongson-community/nixpkgs/issues) and problems in [loongson-community/discussions](https://github.com/loongson-community/discussions/issues).

## Contributing Resources

Our current Loongson hardware can't fully meet the build demands from frequent Nixpkgs changes. If you have spare Loongson devices and want to provide computational support, please [create an Issue](https://github.com/loongson-community/nixpkgs/issues) to contact us.

We currently only have mirror services from a few mirror sites, which doesn't adequately cover users worldwide. If you can provide mirror resources, please contact us through Issues.
